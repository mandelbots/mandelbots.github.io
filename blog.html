				<p>The entire gang, except for Viktor, was here today. I was working on a rough sketch for the robotics Java program
				while the rest of the team worked on setting up the test arena. Unfortunately, the USB cable for flashing the APK to
				the Android phones was not working, so we were not able to test preliminary features yet.</p>
				
				<p>For using the four image markers, we are using <a href="https://vuforia.com">Vuforia</a> to determine the robot location
				in autonomous. For detecting which mineral to displace, I at first planned to use <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>,
				though I may switch to <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> since I found examples in the FTC app for it.</p>

				<h2>Before the Chains of Thunder</h2>
				
				<p>Today, we finished up the robot's chassis and put all the wheels and their sprockets in place. What's left is to
				chain them together and secure that chain in place. After we finished building, we looked into using a worm-gear
				based rack and pinion to lift the robot. We figured we would use this design to avoid the rotation found when a
				normal gear is met with the downwards force placed on it by the robot's weight.</p>

				<h2>Speakeasies</h2>
				
				<p>This week, there were only two of us. Viktor and I worked on the back of the chassis. We attached mechanum wheels
				to sprockets and mounted corresponding motors. We lacked proper hubs to mount sprockets to the motors so we ended up
				performing this season’s first “bootleg.” Viktor used a proper gear as a means of attaching a motor hub to a sprocket.
				That hub could then be attached to the motor.</p>

				<h2>Indian Phone Scammer</h2>
				
				<p>We finished the long task of hanging Benito's parts in the <del>Milan town square</del> <ins>parts bin</ins>.
				That was not the most interesting part of this meeting, however.</p>
				
				<p>An Indian phone scammer called Nicholas that meeting. We knew that the call was from a scammer, but Nicholas
				picked up the phone anyway just to troll the poor scammer. Needless to say, the room became a circus afterwards.</p>

				<h2>The Gang</h2>
				
				<p>Our robotics team expanded from a whopping 3 members to 6 today. Max, Nick Gutierrez, and Viktor
				went to this meeting in addition to the initial members.</p>
				
				<p>Nicholas and I made Max and Nick G. do the work of finishing the disassembling of Benito, with
				Viktor as their overseer. The two of us also had to explain to the new members the design and plan documents
				that we had crafted in their absence.</p>
				
				<p>Unfortunately, none of the members barring Nicholas and I could stay for long. After the others
				left, we started making some progress with modeling the new robot's chain drive.</p>

				<h2>The Incredibles' Revenge</h2>
				
				<p>The last meeting went unlike most of the other meetings for robotics; i.e. it went smoothly.
				Due to the fact that Phuong and I the only members present, we were able to plan and
				design far more efficiently than we would with other teammates. I decided to hold this meeting
				on this date despite the fact that many members are busy with internships and other
				extracurriculars because the team's bane last year was that we had to push all of the
				work to days before the competition. I have decided, furthermore, that meetings will
				henceforth be held weekly regardless of any other conflicting schedules.</p>
				
				<p>We decided that the main theme of this year's team would be to “avenge” the shortcomings
				of last year's team. We will implement a functional chain-based drive train this year,
				whereas we failed to do so last year. We will accurately implement computer vision,
				whereas last year, our robot was a <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong">Blind Bandit</a>
				without the combat potential. We will methodically plan out each case of
				randomized elements for the autonomous period while still refining our game plan to cover
				as many cases as possible.</p>
				
				<p>Thus, we decided on how our robot would be designed. Vertical intake systems,
				a dual-motor rack and pinion lift, and wheels driven by chained sprockets are
				the robot's major features. We designed our plan to program the robot around
				said elements. With everything planned out, we are now able to purchase most of
				the parts we need initially so as to avoid the issues we had last year where parts
				ordered too late, in conjunction with the snail's pace at which the IRS processed
				our documents, caused us to delay our work to three days before the competition.</p>

				<h2>The Robot Rack</h2>
				<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> robotics meeting was…well, a ritual of sorts.</p>
				<p>We hung the beheaded Incredibles figurine onto a rack in the meeting room, and will leave it there as
				a sign of pent-up rage from last Robotics season. After that, we could proceed to disassemble the old robot.</p>
				<p>Luckily for us, most of the old robot's parts were still in perfectly usable condition, especially the
				case for holding the Android brain, which was 3D printed last year, before I joined. As we ritually tortured
				the poor robot, Nicholas unceremoniously gave the dying robot the Italian name Benito (yes, the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini">Italian dictator's</a> name).</p>
				<p>Unluckily, however, the tools for disassembling were scattered about in a mess, so we spend more time
				than we should finding them. We put the tools in a place where we no longer had to spend precious minutes
				searching for them.</p>
				<p>As we ceremonially reflected on various events that transpired last year, we have soon realized that despite my wishes to
				the contrary, I was right: contrary to the spirit of <i>Eminentia ex minimis</i>, many of our peers, who have once been
				noble in character, have indeed descended to such a level that I was utterly unable to comprehend.</p>
				<p>However, at the same time, I reflected on the few peers for which the opposite happened: they remained
				steadfastly strong in spirit, even amongst huge pressure to the contrary—in a few cases, at a deep level.</p>
				<p>I only hope that Nicholas and I do not fall into very trap that I warned him about.</p>

			<div class="blogEntry" id="blogWebsiteRedesign">
				<h2>Redesign of the website</h2>
				<p>The original website was designed 2 years ago. It was a brutalist one, far out of
				touch with modern design standards: the font was good ol' Times New Roman, and the
				drab black-and-white color scheme did not help ease my eyes. Since the original website
				designer has left the Mandelbots in a deep internal schism, I took it upon myself to
				remake the website to modern standards.</p>
				<p>The first thing that I wanted to get rid of was the old color scheme—I truly cannot stand
				the sight of it! I replaced it with a more appealing gradient theme which is not only commonly
				seen in new websites, but also does away with the crudeness of solid colors.</p>
				<p>I also replaced the old website's font (Times New Roman) with the sci-fi
				themed <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo">Exo</a> font, which fits the
				subject matter of the site (robotics) quite well, notwithstanding the fact that Exo
				is also the name of a K-pop band that keeps playing incessantly.</p>
				<p>Finally, to match the design of the website, I redesigned the logo to have a dark theme,
				complete with the motto “Eminentia ex minimis,” which is Latin for “eminence in the least
				[things].” In other words, if one is incapable of creating something great out of unfavorable
				odds, resources, etc., then he has not truly accomplished very much. It is quite fitting not only
				because we have to work with a robot that can only understand the most basic of instructions, but also
				because in real life, we are indeed often faced with unfavorable resources and constraints, and we
				witness people who, despite almost everything driving them down to despondency, still manage to
				push on and rise to excellence—many of whom I personally know.</p>
