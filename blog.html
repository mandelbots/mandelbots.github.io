				<p>The last meeting went unlike the other meetings for robotics; i.e. it went smoothly.
				Due to the fact that Phuong and I the only members present, we were able to plan and
				design far more efficiently than we would with other teammates. I decided to hold this meeting
				on this date despite the fact that many members are busy with internships and other
				extracurriculars because the team's bane last year was that we had to push all of the
				work to days before the competition. I have decided, furthermore, that meetings will
				henceforth be held weekly regardless of any other conflicting schedules.</p>
				
				<p>We decided that the main theme of this year's team would be to “avenge” the shortcomings
				of last year's team. We will implement a functional chain-based drive train this year,
				whereas we failed to do so last year. We will accurately implement computer vision,
				whereas last year, our robot was a <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong">Blind Bandit</a>
				without the combat potential. We will methodically plan out each case of
				randomized elements for the autonomous period while still refining our game plan to cover
				as many cases as possible.</p>
				
				<p>Thus, we decided on how our robot would be designed. Vertical intake systems,
				a dual-motor rack and pinion lift, and wheels driven by chained sprockets are
				the robot's major features. We designed our plan to program the robot around
				said elements. With everything planned out, we are now able to purchase most of
				the parts we need initially so as to avoid the issues we had last year where parts
				ordered too late, in conjunction with the snail's pace at which the IRS processed
				our documents, caused us to delay our work to three days before the competition.</p>

				<h2>The Robot Rack</h2>
				<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> robotics meeting was…well, a ritual of sorts.</p>
				<p>We hung the beheaded Incredibles figurine onto a rack in the meeting room, and will leave it there as
				a sign of pent-up rage from last Robotics season. After that, we could proceed to disassemble the old robot.</p>
				<p>Luckily for us, most of the old robot's parts were still in perfectly usable condition, especially the
				case for holding the Android brain, which was 3D printed last year, before I joined. As we ritually tortured
				the poor robot, Nicholas unceremoniously gave the dying robot the Italian name Benito (yes, the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini">Italian dictator's</a> name).</p>
				<p>Unluckily, however, the tools for disassembling were scattered about in a mess, so we spend more time
				than we should finding them. We put the tools in a place where we no longer had to spend precious minutes
				searching for them.</p>
				<p>As we ceremonially reflected on various events that transpired last year, we have soon realized that despite my wishes to
				the contrary, I was right: contrary to the spirit of <i>Eminentia ex minimis</i>, many of our peers, who have once been
				noble in character, have indeed descended to such a level that I was utterly unable to comprehend.</p>
				<p>However, at the same time, I reflected on the few peers for which the opposite happened: they remained
				steadfastly strong in spirit, even amongst huge pressure to the contrary—in a few cases, at a deep level.</p>
				<p>I only hope that Nicholas and I do not fall into very trap that I warned him about.</p>

				<h2>Redesign of the website</h2>
				<p>The original website was designed 2 years ago. It was a brutalist one, far out of
				touch with modern design standards: the font was good ol' Times New Roman, and the
				drab black-and-white color scheme did not help ease my eyes. Since the original website
				designer has left the Mandelbots in a deep internal schism, I took it upon myself to
				remake the website to modern standards.</p>
				<p>The first thing that I wanted to get rid of was the old color scheme—I truly cannot stand
				the sight of it! I replaced it with a more appealing gradient theme which is not only commonly
				seen in new websites, but also does away with the crudeness of solid colors.</p>
				<p>I also replaced the old website's font (Times New Roman) with the sci-fi
				themed <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo">Exo</a> font, which fits the
				subject matter of the site (robotics) quite well, notwithstanding the fact that Exo
				is also the name of a K-pop band that keeps playing incessantly.</p>
				<p>Finally, to match the design of the website, I redesigned the logo to have a dark theme,
				complete with the motto “Eminentia ex minimis,” which is Latin for “eminence in the least
				[things].” In other words, if one is incapable of creating something great out of unfavorable
				odds, resources, etc., then he has not truly accomplished very much. It is quite fitting not only
				because we have to work with a robot that can only understand the most basic of instructions, but also
				because in real life, we are indeed often faced with unfavorable resources and constraints, and we
				witness people who, despite almost everything driving them down to despondency, still manage to
				push on and rise to excellence—many of whom I personally know.</p>
