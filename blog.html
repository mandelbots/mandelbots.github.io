				<h2>Redesign of the website</h2>
				<p>The original website was designed 2 years ago. It was a brutalist one, far out of
				touch with modern design standards: the font was good ol' Times New Roman, and the
				drab black-and-white color scheme did not help ease my eyes. Since the original website
				designer has left the Mandelbots in a deep internal schism, I took it upon myself to
				remake the website to modern standards.</p>
				<p>The first thing that I wanted to get rid of was the old color scheme—I truly cannot stand
				the sight of it! I replaced it with a more appealing gradient theme which is not only commonly
				seen in new websites, but also does away with the crudeness of solid colors.</p>
				<p>I also replaced the old website's font (Times New Roman) with the sci-fi
				themed <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo">Exo</a> font, which fits the
				subject matter of the site (robotics) quite well, notwithstanding the fact that Exo
				is also the name of a K-pop band that keeps playing incessantly.</p>
				<p>Finally, to match the design of the website, I redesigned the logo to have a dark theme,
				complete with the motto “Eminentia ex minimis,” which is Latin for “eminence in the least
				[things].” In other words, if one is incapable of creating something great out of unfavorable
				odds, resources, etc., then he has not truly accomplished very much. It is quite fitting not only
				because we have to work with a robot that can only understand the most basic of instructions, but also
				because in real life, we are indeed often faced with unfavorable resources and constraints, and we
				witness people who, despite almost everything driving them down to despondency, still manage to
				push on and rise to excellence—many of whom I personally know.</p>
